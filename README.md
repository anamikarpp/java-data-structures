# Data Structures from Scratch (Java)

This repository contains my custom implementations of essential data structures using Java. Each structure is built from the ground up without relying on built-in libraries, with the goal of deeply understanding how they work internally.

## 📦 What's Inside

- 🔹 Binary Search Tree (BST)
- 🔹 Hash Table
- 🔹 Map (custom key-value structure)
- 🔹 Linked List (Singly & Doubly)
- 🔹 Stack and Queue
- 🔹 Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order)
- 🔹 Additional structures coming soon...

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is part of my learning journey to master data structures and algorithms by implementing them manually. It helps:
- Reinforce core CS concepts
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Improve problem-solving skills

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: Java 17+
- No external libraries – pure Java logic
- Tested through simple `main` methods (JUnit coming soon)
